Depends on pbs_python (RPM for SL4/Torque 2 available at 
http://grid.ie/distribution/clustermon).

Should be able to run either on the PBS head node, or a 
separate machine authorised as a client of the head node. 
(To configure the server address, edit the configuration
file /etc/pbswebmon.conf)

= Manual installation =

Put cgi-bin/pbswebmon.py into your CGI directory.

Put the js and css files in a directory called pbswebmon under your web root.

(The RPM install will put the files in these locations.)
